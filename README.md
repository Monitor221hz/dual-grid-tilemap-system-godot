# âœ¨ðŸ‘¯ Dual-grid tilemap system in Godot ðŸ‘¯âœ¨

#### This is a demo of how I implemented a dual-grid tilemap system in Godot 4.2. Hope it helps!

Long story short, it does NOT use terrain tiles but rather, a custom C# script that inherits from `TileMap`!

The main reasons I love the dual-grid approach as opposed to regular terrain tiles/auto tiles 
is because:
- it allows the tiles to have perfectly rounded corners
- a maximum of only 16 tiles are required in the tileset (you could cut that number down to 6 if your tiles have symmetry)
- the tiles align with the world grid

One could also argue it's more effecient since each tile only checks 4 neighbours as opposed to 9 ðŸ¤¯. But haven't done any performance testing so no promises ðŸ˜….

Just like Oskar, I don't understand why this isn't more popular!

Dual-grid system is also mentioned in ThinMatrix's video, 
which is what inspired me in the first place: https://youtu.be/buKQjkad2I0?si=9xot1uUw3PvNWvT9&t=234
