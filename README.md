# âœ¨ðŸ‘¯ Dual-grid tilemap system in Godot ðŸ‘¯âœ¨

#### This is a demo of how I implemented a simple dual-grid tilemap system in Godot 4.2 Mono using C#. Hope it helps!

If you are looking for a GDScript version, here are some I recommend:
- Godot 4.2: [https://github.com/GlitchedinOrbit/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot-gdscript](https://github.com/GlitchedinOrbit/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot-gdscript)
- Godot 4.3: [https://github.com/pablogila/TileMapDual_godot_node](https://github.com/pablogila/TileMapDual_godot_node) <-- this one also enables refreshing tiles from the editor!

Long story short, it does NOT use terrain tiles but acts very similarly to them. It's just a custom script that inherits from `TileMap`! The MainScene shows how it's done with two seperate Tilemaps, and there is also another scene showing how it's done with tilemap layers instead. Since you can't offset the layers individually, the tiles themselves are offset (which you can find in the TileSet settings).

The main reasons I love the dual-grid approach as opposed to regular terrain tiles/auto tiles 
is because:
- it allows the tiles to have perfectly rounded corners
- a maximum of only 16 tiles are required in the tileset (you could cut that number down to 6 if your tiles have symmetry)
- the tiles align with the world grid

One could also argue it's more efficient, since each tile only checks 4 neighbours as opposed to 8. But I haven't done any performance testing so no promises.

I also made a version for Unity which you can find [here](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-unity)

Just like Oskar...I don't understand why the dual-grid method isn't more popular!

Dual-grid system is also mentioned in ThinMatrix's video, 
which is what inspired me in the first place: https://youtu.be/buKQjkad2I0?si=9xot1uUw3PvNWvT9&t=234
